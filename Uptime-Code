Perfect 👍 For a leadership dashboard in SolarWinds, you want something clean, high-level, and SLA-focused (not too technical). Leadership usually wants quick insights (green = good, red = bad), trends over time, and SLA compliance. Here’s how you can build it:

🎯 Leadership Uptime Dashboard Layout (SolarWinds Modern Dashboards)
1. Overall Uptime KPI

Widget Type: KPI Number or Gauge

What It Shows:

Overall uptime across all monitored nodes (last 30 days).

Target SLA threshold (e.g., 99.9%) shown as baseline.

Implementation:

Create a SWQL query widget using something like:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(100 - (N.DownTimePercent * 100)),2) AS [Availability %]
FROM Orion.Nodes N

2. SLA Compliance Indicator

Widget Type: KPI / Pie Chart

What It Shows: % of nodes meeting SLA (e.g., >99.9%) vs. those that don’t.

Implementation:

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN ROUND(100 - (N.DownTimePercent * 100),2) >= 99.9 THEN 'In SLA'
    ELSE 'Out of SLA'
  END AS [SLA Status],
  COUNT(*) AS [Node Count]
FROM Orion.Nodes N
GROUP BY 
  CASE 
    WHEN ROUND(100 - (N.DownTimePercent * 100),2) >= 99.9 THEN 'In SLA'
    ELSE 'Out of SLA'
  END

3. Availability Trend (Last 90 Days)

Widget Type: Line Chart

What It Shows: Average availability trend per day (or week).

Implementation:

SELECT 
  TOLOCAL(DATETRUNC('day', A.DateTime)) AS [Date],
  ROUND(AVG(A.Availability),2) AS [Avg Availability %]
FROM Orion.AvailabilityHistory A
WHERE A.EntityType = 'Orion.Nodes'
  AND A.DateTime > DATEADD(day, -90, GETUTCDATE())
GROUP BY TOLOCAL(DATETRUNC('day', A.DateTime))
ORDER BY [Date]

4. Top 5 Problematic Nodes

Widget Type: Table

What It Shows: Nodes with the lowest availability in last 30 days.

Implementation:

SELECT TOP 5
    N.Caption AS [Node],
    ROUND(AVG(A.Availability),2) AS [Availability %],
    ISNULL(N.Location,'Unassigned') AS [Location]
FROM Orion.AvailabilityHistory A
JOIN Orion.Nodes N ON N.NodeID = A.EntityID
WHERE A.EntityType = 'Orion.Nodes'
  AND A.DateTime >= DATEADD(day,-30,GETUTCDATE())
GROUP BY N.Caption, N.Location
ORDER BY [Availability %] ASC


5. Availability by Region/Business Unit

Widget Type: Bar Chart or Donut

What It Shows: Uptime grouped by location, region, or custom property (e.g., Business Unit).

Implementation:
(Assuming you use the CustomProperties.Region field)

SELECT 
  N.CustomProperties.Region,
  ROUND(AVG(100 - (N.DownTimePercent * 100)),2) AS [Availability %]
FROM Orion.Nodes N
GROUP BY N.CustomProperties.Region
ORDER BY [Availability %] ASC

6. Recent Critical Outages

Widget Type: Event Table

What It Shows: Last 10 node-down events (with timestamps and duration).

Implementation:

SELECT TOP 10
  N.Caption AS [Node],
  E.EventTime,
  E.Message
FROM Orion.Events E
JOIN Orion.Nodes N ON E.NetworkNode = N.NodeID
WHERE E.EventType = 1  -- Node Down
ORDER BY E.EventTime DESC

📊 Recommended Layout

Top Row:

Overall Uptime KPI

SLA Compliance Pie

Middle Row:

Availability Trend (line chart)

Availability by Region (bar/pie)

Bottom Row:

Top 5 Problematic Nodes (table)

Recent Critical Outages (table)

👉 This will give leadership a clean, SLA-driven dashboard that answers:

"Are we meeting our uptime goals?"

"Where are we struggling?"

"Are there trends or repeat offenders?"
