Perfect — here’s a complete, ready-to-copy Leadership Uptime Dashboard configuration for your SolarWinds Modern Dashboard using only the available widgets (KPI, Proportional, Table, Drilldown, Map). All tiles include working SWQL queries, thresholds, and suggested layout for leadership.

Leadership Uptime Dashboard – Full Configuration
Row 1 – KPIs and SLA
1️⃣ Overall Availability (KPI)

Widget: KPI

SWQL Query:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(RT.Availability), 2) AS AvailabilityPct
FROM Orion.ResponseTime RT
WHERE RT.DateTime >= ADDDAY(-30, GETDATE())


Title: Overall Availability (30d)

Thresholds:

Green ≥ 99.9

Yellow 99.0–99.89

Red < 99.0

2️⃣ SLA Compliance (Proportional / Donut)

Widget: Proportional (Donut)

SWQL Query:

SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN ROUND(
      (SELECT AVG(RT2.Availability)
       FROM Orion.ResponseTime RT2
       WHERE RT2.NodeID = N.NodeID
         AND RT2.DateTime >= ADDDAY(-30, GETDATE()))
    ,2) >= 99.9 THEN 'In SLA'
    ELSE 'Out of SLA'
  END AS SLAStatus,
  1 AS NodeCount
FROM Orion.Nodes N
WHERE N.UnManaged = FALSE


Visualization: Category = SLAStatus, Value = Sum(NodeCount)

Title: SLA Compliance (≥99.9%, 30d)

Row 2 – Regional & Trend Snapshot
3️⃣ Availability by Region (Proportional / Bar)

Widget: Proportional (Bar)

SWQL Query:

SELECT
  ISNULL(N.CustomProperties.Region,'Unassigned') AS Region,
  ROUND(AVG(RT.Availability),2) AS AvailabilityPct
FROM Orion.ResponseTime RT
JOIN Orion.Nodes N ON N.NodeID = RT.NodeID
WHERE RT.DateTime >= ADDDAY(-30, GETDATE())
GROUP BY N.CustomProperties.Region
ORDER BY AvailabilityPct ASC


Title: Availability by Region (30d)

4️⃣ 30-Day vs 90-Day Availability KPIs (Trend Snapshot)

Widget 1: KPI – 30-Day

SELECT ROUND(AVG(RT.Availability),2) AS AvailabilityPct
FROM Orion.ResponseTime RT
WHERE RT.DateTime >= ADDDAY(-30, GETDATE())


Title: 30-Day Avg Availability

Thresholds: Green ≥ 99.9, Yellow 99.0–99.89, Red < 99.0

Widget 2: KPI – 90-Day

SELECT ROUND(AVG(RT.Availability),2) AS AvailabilityPct
FROM Orion.ResponseTime RT
WHERE RT.DateTime >= ADDDAY(-90, GETDATE())


Title: 90-Day Avg Availability

Thresholds: Same as above

Row 3 – Problematic Nodes & Recent Events
5️⃣ Top 5 Lowest Availability Nodes (Table with Thresholds)

Widget: Table

SWQL Query:

SELECT TOP 5
  N.Caption AS Node,
  ROUND(AVG(RT.Availability), 2) AS AvailabilityPct,
  ISNULL(N.Location, 'Unassigned') AS Location
FROM Orion.ResponseTime RT
JOIN Orion.Nodes N ON N.NodeID = RT.NodeID
WHERE RT.DateTime >= ADDDAY(-30, GETDATE())
GROUP BY N.Caption, N.Location
ORDER BY AvailabilityPct ASC


Thresholds (AvailabilityPct column):

Green ≥ 99.9

Yellow 99.0–99.89

Red < 99.0

Title: Lowest Availability Nodes (30d)

6️⃣ Recent Node Up/Down Events (Table)

Widget: Table

SWQL Query:

SELECT TOP 10
  E.EventTime AS [When],
  N.Caption   AS Node,
  ET.Name     AS Event
FROM Orion.Events E
JOIN Orion.EventTypes ET ON ET.EventType = E.EventType
JOIN Orion.Nodes N       ON N.NodeID     = E.NetworkNode
WHERE E.EventType IN (1,2)  -- 1 = Node Down, 2 = Node Up
ORDER BY E.EventTime DESC


Title: Recent Node Up/Down Events

📐 Suggested Dashboard Layout
Row	Left	Right
1	Overall Availability (KPI)	SLA Compliance (Proportional)
2	Availability by Region (Proportional)	30-Day KPI & 90-Day KPI side by side
3	Top 5 Lowest Availability Nodes (Table)	Recent Node Up/Down Events (Table)

Row 2’s KPIs can either be two small tiles side-by-side or stacked vertically depending on screen width.

All KPI and Table thresholds use the SLA-friendly color scheme for immediate visual cues.

This gives leadership:

High-level KPI for total uptime

SLA compliance percentage

Regional breakdown

Trend snapshot via 30d vs 90d KPIs

Quick identification of problem nodes and recent outages


Ask ChatGPT to modify this for the last three months: 
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        (SUM(Availability) / COUNT(Availability)), 3
    ) AS [Overall Uptime Percentage (Last 30 Days)]
FROM (
    SELECT 
        n.NodeID,
        n.Caption,
        a.Availability
    FROM Orion.Nodes n
    JOIN Orion.ResponseTime a ON n.NodeID = a.NodeID
    WHERE MONTH(a.DateTime) = MONTH(GETDATE() - 1)
      AND YEAR(a.DateTime) = YEAR(GETDATE() - 1)
) AS UptimeData

Result:

SELECT 
    ROUND(
        (SUM(RT.Availability) / COUNT(RT.Availability)), 2
    ) AS [Overall Availability %]
FROM Orion.ResponseTime RT
JOIN Orion.Nodes N ON N.NodeID = RT.NodeID
WHERE 
    MONTH(RT.DateTime) = MONTH(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()))
    AND YEAR(RT.DateTime) = YEAR(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()))
